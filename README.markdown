What's this?
============

An GeoHash library for Scala.

It is originally implemented by @yuroyoro.
Actually what I have done is just implementing the encoding functionality, for now.

Getting Started
===============

    % git clone git://github.com/mumoshu/geohash-scala.git
    % cd geohash-scala
    % sbt

In sbt prompt, type `update` to download all the dependent libraries,
then type `test` to run tests.

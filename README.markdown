=WHAT'S THIS?
An GeoHash library for Scala.

It is originally implemented by @yuroyoro.
Actually what I have done is just implementing the encoding functionality, for now.

=GETTING STARTED
% git clone git://github.com/mumoshu/geohash-scala.git
% cd geohash-scala
% sbt

In sbt prompt, type `update` to download all the dependent libraries,
then type `test` to run tests.
